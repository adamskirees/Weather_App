# Weather-Journal App Project (Part of Udacity front end developer Nanodegree - third project)

## Overview
This is a first attempt at creating an asynchronous web app - it will use a well known Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI webpage.

Data will be pulled from the OpenWeather Map API - https://openweathermap.org/api

When coming ot the web page, the user will be able to enter their current US zipcode and a comment, a seperate section of the web page will dynamically update to show the current tempretaure, comment and date stamp. 

We will be using Node and express and installing various dependencies. Some more details of running the project can be seen below in the instructions.
